Karafka-Testing is a library that provides RSpec helpers, to make testing of Karafka consumers much easier.

## Installation

Add this gem to your Gemfile in the `test` group:
```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'karafka-testing'
  gem 'rspec'
end
```

and then in your `spec_helper.rb` file:

```ruby
require 'karafka/testing/rspec/helpers'

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include Karafka::Testing::RSpec::Helpers
end
```

## Usage

Once included into your RSpec setup, this library will provide you with a special object `#karafka` that includes two methods that you can use with your specs:

- `#consumer_for` - creates a consumer instance for the desired topic. It **needs** to be set as the spec subject.
- `#publish` - "sends" message to the consumer instance.

**Note:** Messages sent using the `#publish` method won't be sent to Kafka. They will be "virtually" delegated to the created consumer instance so your specs can run without Kafka setup.

```ruby
RSpec.describe InlineBatchConsumer do
  # This will create a consumer instance with all the settings defined for the given topic
  subject(:consumer) { karafka.consumer_for(:inline_batch_data) }

  let(:nr1_value) { rand }
  let(:nr2_value) { rand }
  let(:sum) { nr1_value + nr2_value }

  before do
    # Sends first message to Karafka consumer
    karafka.publish({ 'number' => nr1_value }.to_json)
    # Sends second message to Karafka consumer
    karafka.publish({ 'number' => nr2_value }.to_json, partition: 2)
    allow(Karafka.logger).to receive(:info)
  end

  it 'expects to log a proper message' do
    expect(Karafka.logger).to receive(:info).with("Sum of 2 elements equals to: #{sum}")
    consumer.consume
  end
end
```

If your consumers use `producer` to dispatch messages, you can set up your expectations against it as well:

```ruby
RSpec.describe InlineBatchConsumer do
  subject(:consumer) { karafka.consumer_for(:inline_batch_data) }

  before { karafka.publish({ 'number' => 1 }.to_json) }

  it 'expects to dispatch async message to messages topic with value bigger by 1' do
    expect(consumer.producer)
      .to receive(:produce_async)
      .with(topic: 'messages', payload: { number: 2 }.to_json)

    consumer.consume
  end
end
```
